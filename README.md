# 🚀 Esteam – Service Provider App (Frontend)

Esteam is a modern service provider platform UI designed to connect customers with local workers and helpers.
This repository contains the frontend application, built using HTML, CSS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, and PostCSS.

## 💡 About the Project

Esteam aims to simplify the way customers find and connect with **blue-collar service providers** (electricians, plumbers, carpenters, cleaners, etc.).

This frontend MVP showcases the **user interface and basic workflows** for:

* Browsing available service providers
* Viewing details of workers
* Booking services (UI flow only – backend integration coming soon)


## ✨ Features (Frontend Only)

* 🎨 Responsive UI built with TailwindCSS
* 🧑‍💼 Separate views for customers and workers
* 📂 Clean, component-based code structure

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **TailwindCSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Core logic
* **HTML5 & CSS3** – Semantic markup & styling
* **PostCSS** – CSS processing and optimization

## 📥 Installation

```bash
